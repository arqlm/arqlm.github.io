Ore Body Modeling
=====================================================================

Ore body resource and reserve evaluation is a highly quantitative discipline,
and professionals dedicated to it must have the necessary skills to analyze
quantitatively the available information. This course takes a practical approach to developing
these skills. Together, we will analyze real information taken from ore bodies. We will learn how to
organize, analyze, and generate new graphical and interactive information from the
geological data received, useful for decision-making on investment and planning.
